  <description>
    <p>The feature-packed, cross-platform game engine to create 2D and 3D games from a unified interface. Redot Engine provides a comprehensive set of common tools, so that you can focus on making games without having to reinvent the wheel. Games can be exported in one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows) as well as mobile (Android, iOS), web-based (HTML5) platforms and consoles (Switch, PS4 and Xbox One - via thirdparty publishers).</p>
    <p>Completely free and open source under the very permissive MIT license. No strings attached, no royalties, nothing. Your game is yours down to the last line of engine code. Redot's development is fully independent and community-driven, empowering you to help shape the engine to match your expectations. It is supported by the non-profit Redot Foundation.</p>
    <p>Create games with ease, using Redot's unique approach to game development:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nodes for all your needs. Redot comes with hundreds of built-in nodes that make game design a breeze. You can also create your own for custom behaviors, editors and much more.</li>
      <li>Flexible scene system. Create node compositions with support for instancing and inheritance.</li>
      <li>Visual editor with all the tools you need packed into a beautiful and uncluttered context-sensitive UI.</li>
      <li>Friendly content creation pipeline for artists, level designers, animators and everything in between.</li>
      <li>Persistent live editing where changes are not lost after stopping the game. It even works on mobile devices!</li>
      <li>Create your own custom tools with ease using the incredible tool system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Current limitations of this Flatpak version:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>For C#/Mono support, install org.redotengine.GodotSharp instead: https://flathub.org/apps/org.redotengine.GodotSharp</li>
      <li>External script editors are supported, but you need to follow the steps described here: https://github.com/flathub/org.redotengine.Redot#using-an-external-script-editor</li>
      <li>Redot 4's Blender importer is supported, but Blender needs to be installed on your system and you need to follow the steps described here: https://github.com/flathub/org.redotengine.Redot#using-blender</li>
      <li>For projects using text-to-speech, make sure speech-dispatcher is installed on your system, so that this Flatpak can access it.</li>
    </ul>
